# Pair Learning

@nieldm and I started learning together. Feel free to join or discuss.

The book we are going over at the moment is Data Structures and Algorithms in Swift, 4th Edition.
The solutions presented here are based on the starting point provided by the book here: https://github.com/raywenderlich/alg-materials

We agree to read a chapter and solve the challenges without looking at the answers. Then we compare and discuss how it went.
